# Python challenge  
## Description  
I was asked to create a Python script to analyse the financial records of a company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".   
The main task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:  
- The total number of months included in the dataset  
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes  
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
## Results  
On this repository, there are two folders called PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder has a Python file called main.py with the solution for each task. The solution is printed on the terminal and it generates a .txt file in folder Analysis with the same results. See below some screenshots of the results.
